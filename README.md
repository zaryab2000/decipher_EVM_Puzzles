Decipher EVM puzzles are basically a collection of EVM opcodes puzzles that includes a bunch of different opcodes which can be executed successfully only if you provide the right inputs.

The Decipher EVM Puzzle game is an extended version of [Franco's EVM puzzles](https://github.com/fvictorio/evm-puzzles) but with *additional complexity, a difficulty-level selector making it available not just for senior devs but also beginners, and more interesting puzzles covering a wide range of opcodes*.

Every puzzle might require one of the following as input from the player:
* CallData only 
* CallValue only 
* Both CallData & CallValue

Your main goal as a player is to provide the right set of inputs so that the transaction doesn't get reverted. 

>If it reverts, you FAIL...‚ùå If it executes successfully, You SOLVED that particular puzzle. ‚úÖ

### Imperative Note
* Solutions to puzzles can have more a formulae instead of one specific value.
    * For instance, some puzzles may require a type of input where **Calldata size must be n** and **CallValue must be n+4**,in order for you to solve it correctly.
    * For such cases, correct **CallData Size can be 4 or 5 or 6 and CallValue can be 8 or 9 or 10 respectively**
    * It's imperative to understand the formulae rather than chasing 1 specific calldata size or callvalue as the right answer, for such a puzzle
* Solutions to the same puzzle can also be more than 1 specific input.
